# go-mcp-streamable-sse-minimal

> A minimal demonstration of streamable Server-Sent Events (SSE) using Go with MCP.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository showcases a **simple and minimal** implementation of **MCP** using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** in Go.

The goal is to help developers understand how to use streamable SSE in Go for real-time message delivery with MCP-style communication patterns.

## 🚫 Not Production Code

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This project is intended **for learning and demonstration purposes only**. It is **not production-ready**. The focus is on clarity and minimal setup, not on performance, error handling, or security.


## 🛠️ How to Run

go run main.go 

## 🧪 How to Test

use transport streamable http.   
host:   
http://localhost:8080/sse
